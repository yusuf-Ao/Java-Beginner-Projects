##### Project Description
Battleship (also called Battleships or Sea Battle) is a two-player strategy game whose history traces back to the First World War. There are different variations of the Battleship game, but we will stick to the original rules written by Milton Bradley. You have a 10×10 game field and five ships to arrange on that field. The ships can be placed horizontally or vertically but not diagonally across the grid spaces; the ships should not cross or touch each other. The goal is to sink all the ships of the opponent before your opponent does this to you.You can read more on the rules of the game here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game).

In this project, we get the chance to practice on topics like, Inheritance, Abstract class, Method overriding, Use of regex (Pattern and Matcher), conditionals, Enumeration and lots more.
#### Description
- On a 10x10 field, the first row should contain numbers from 1 to 10 indicating the column, and the first column should contain letters from A to J indicating the row.
- The symbol ~ denotes the fog of war: the unknown area on the opponent's field and the yet untouched area on your field.
- The symbol O denotes a cell with your ship, X denotes that the ship was hit, and M signifies a miss.
- You have 5 ships: Aircraft Carrier is 5 cells, Battleship is 4 cells, Submarine is 3 cells, Cruiser is also 3 cells, and Destroyer is 2 cells. Start placing your ships with the largest one.
- To place a ship, enter two coordinates: the beginning and the end of the ship.
- If an error occurs in the input coordinates, your program should report it. The message should contain the word Error
- Both players add the ships to their fields one by one (no peeking!), and then start shelling each other until one of them succeeds. To make the game fair and prevent the players from peeping at each other's fields, after each move add the message "Press Enter and pass the move to another player", which will clear the screen.
-To make a shot, we indicate the coordinates of the target, and the program should then display a message about a hit or a miss. If the shell misses the target and falls in the water, this cell should be marked with an M, and a successful strike is marked by an X. 
-The game stops execution as soon as a winner emerges.
