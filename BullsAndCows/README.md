##### Project Description
Bulls and Cows Game is also known as MasterMind. In this version of the game, I have added more twist to the [**original version**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows) to make the game play more interesting and challenging. 
The system generates a secret code based on the players' input. The secret code can contain the numbers 0-9 and the lowercase Latin characters a-z, without duplicate/repetition. And the maximum length for the code is 36. 

#### Objectives
- Ask for the length of the secret code.
- Ask for the range of possible characters in the secret code.
- Generate a secret code using numbers and characters. This time, you should also print the secret code using * characters and print which characters were used to generate the secret code.
- Function as a fully playable game.

The secret code is been generated by a simple implementation of the java random class.

#### Feel free to go through each line of code to understand what it does.
