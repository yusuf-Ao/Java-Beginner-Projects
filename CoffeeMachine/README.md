##### Project Description
- A simple implementation of a coffee machine, virtual coffee, of course. In this project, I implemented functionality that simulates a real coffee machine. It can run out of milk, it can run out of coffee beans, it can make different varieties of coffee, and it can take the money for making a coffee.
- This program will help you practice more on methods and conditionals. 
- Try exploring what it can do.. I bet it'll make you a coffee 😜
