##  Simple Tic-Tac-Toe

##### Project Description
- The game starts by printing an empty grid. It then prompts the user to enter the cell coordinates to make his move.
- The first player has to play as X and their opponent plays as O.
- The first cell has the coordinates (1, 1) and the last cell has the coordinates (3, 3)
- The first coordinate goes from top to bottom and the second coordinate goes from left to right. Also note that coordinates start with 1 and can be 1, 2, or 3.
  (1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3)
  (2, 1) (2, 2) (2, 3)
  (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 3)

##  Simple Coffee Machine

##### Project Description
- A simple implementation of a coffee machine, virtual coffee, of course. In this project, I implemented functionality that simulates a real coffee machine. It can run out of milk, it can run out of coffee beans, it can make different varieties of coffee, and it can take the money for making a coffee.
- This program will help you practice more on methods and conditionals. 
- Try exploring what it can do.. I bet it'll make you a coffee 😜
